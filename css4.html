            These docs are old and won’t be updated. Go to react.dev for the new React docs.

            These new documentation pages teach React with Hooks:

                   Quick Start
                  Tutorial
               react: Hooks
            Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

                At React Conf 2018, Sophie Alpert and Dan Abramov introduced Hooks, followed by Ryan Florence demonstrating how to refactor an application to use them. Watch the video here:

            Before we continue, note that Hooks are:

            Completely opt-in. You can try Hooks in a few components without rewriting any existing code. But you don’t have to learn or use Hooks right now if you don’t want to.
            100% backwards-compatible. Hooks don’t contain any breaking changes.
            Available now. Hooks are now available with the release of v16.8.0.
            There are no plans to remove classes from React. You can read more about the gradual adoption strategy for Hooks in the bottom section of this page.
            
            Hooks don’t replace your knowledge of React concepts. Instead, Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. As we will show later, Hooks also offer a new powerful way to combine them.
            
            If you just want to start learning Hooks, feel free to jump directly to the next page! You can also keep reading this page to learn more about why we’re adding Hooks, and how we’re going to start using them without rewriting our applications.

                First, a little bit of housekeeping.

To celebrate the launch of the new docs and, more importantly, to clearly separate the old and the new content, we’ve moved to the shorter react.dev domain. The old reactjs.org domain will now redirect here.

The old React docs are now archived at legacy.reactjs.org. All existing links to the old content will automatically redirect there to avoid “breaking the web”, but the legacy site will not get many more updates.

Believe it or not, React will soon be ten years old. In JavaScript years, it’s like a whole century! We’ve refreshed the React homepage to reflect why we think React is a great way to create user interfaces today, and updated the getting started guides to more prominently mention modern React-based frameworks.

If you haven’t seen the new homepage yet, check it out!
